We are excited to launch the official website for Team Carpinchos!

This site will serve as the central hub for information about our team, our participation in HPC competitions like the Student Cluster Competition (SCC), and updates on our progress.

Explore the site to learn more about our mission, meet the team members, and see the events we've attended.

More content and features will be added soon. Stay tuned!
