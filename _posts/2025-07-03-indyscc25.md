We received "Congratulations once again on your acceptance to the IndySCC at SC25!"

And not only that, we have also been selected to participate in the onsite competition. But now we have to work hard to make the necessary paperwork to travel.

The team participating is comprised of:
- Ignacio Facello
- Javier Mercado
- Lara Kurtz
- Milagros Carabelos
- Tomas Bazan
- Tomas Hubman

We’d like to thank our advisor, Alejandro Silva, for his invaluable support during our preparation.

This exciting opportunity motivates us to train even harder and deliver our best performance.
